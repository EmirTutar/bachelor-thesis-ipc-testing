## Overview
This bachelor's thesis deals with developing and evaluating a system testing framework for Inter-Process Communication (IPC) based on eCAL (enhanced Communication Abstraction Layer). The aim is to create a standardized and reliable method to test distributed applications, ensuring stable communication, robustness, and performance in realistic scenarios.

## Motivation
As distributed systems become increasingly complex and requirements grow in industries such as automotive, robotics, and IoT, reliable middleware solutions become more important. eCAL is a high-performance IPC framework, but currently, there is no standardized method for comprehensive system testing.

This thesis addresses this gap by:
- Creating a systematic approach to system tests
- Developing specific test cases and automation
- Evaluating test results and integrating them into CI/CD pipelines

## Main Topics
- Basics of IPC and eCAL architecture
- Defining requirements and test cases
- Development and implementation of tests
- Evaluation of test results
- Automation and integration into CI/CD
